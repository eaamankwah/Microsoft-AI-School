# Exercise 11 - Recurrent Neural Networks
# ========
# 
# A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of neural network that excels when your data can be treated as a sequence - such as text, music, speech recognition, connected handwriting, or data over a time period. 
# 
# RNN's can analyse or predict a word based on the previous words in a sentence - they allow a connection between previous information and current information.
# 
# This exercise looks at implementing a LSTM RNN to generate new characters after learning from a large sample of text. LSTMs are a special type of RNN which dramatically improves the model’s ability to connect previous data to current data where there is a long gap.
# 
# We will train an RNN model using a novel written by H. G. Wells - The Time Machine.

# Step 1
# ------
# 
# Let's start by loading our libraries and text file. This might take a few minutes.
# 
# #### Run the cell below to import the necessary libraries.

text = io.open('Data/<addFileName>.txt', encoding = 'UTF-8').read()
###

# Let's have a look at some of the text
print(text[0:198])

# This cuts out punctuation and make all the characters lower case
text = text.lower().translate(str.maketrans("", "", string.punctuation))

# Character index dictionary
charset = sorted(list(set(text)))
index_from_char = dict((c, i) for i, c in enumerate(charset))
char_from_index = dict((i, c) for i, c in enumerate(charset))

# ```The Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was expounding a recondite matter to us. His pale grey eyes shone and twinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated.
# text length: 174201 characters
# unique characters: 39```
# 
# Step 2
# -----
# 
# Next we'll divide the text into sequences of 40 characters.

# Step 3
# ------
# 
# Let's build our model, using a single LSTM layer of 128 units. We'll keep the model simple for now, so that training does not take too long.

# ### In the cell below replace:

# The code below generates text at the end of an epoch (one training cycle). This allows us to see how the model is performing as it trains. If you're making a large neural network with a long training time it's useful to check in on the model as see if the text generating is legible as it trains, as overtraining may occur and the output of the model turn to nonsense.

# The output won't appear to be very good. But then, this dataset is small, and we have trained it only for a short time using a rather small RNN. How might it look if we upscaled things?
# 
# Step 5
# ------
# 
# We could improve our model by:
# * Having a larger training set.
# * Increasing the number of LSTM units.
# * Training it for longer
# * Experimenting with difference activation functions, optimization functions etc
# 
# Training this would still take far too long on most computers to see good results - so we've trained a model already for you.
# 
# This model uses a different dataset - a few of the King Arthur tales pasted together. The model used:
# * sequences of 50 characters
# * Two LSTM layers (512 units each)
# * A dropout of 0.5 after each LSTM layer
# * Only 30 epochs (we'd recomend 100-200)
# 
# Let's try importing this model that has already been trained.

# How does it look? Does it seem intelligible?
# 
# Conclusion
# --------
# 
# We have trained an RNN that learns to predict characters based on a text sequence. We have trained a lightweight model from scratch, as well as imported a pre-trained model and generated new text from that.
